# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
### Purpose
Louise wants to figure out how launch dates and funding goals change the outcome of campaigns, which can be analyzed through various visualizations.  
## Analysis and Challenges
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

The best times for Louise to launch the theater category is between March and May, posing a smaller risk of failing as well during that time. Another peak time is in October, but this time is riskier as the chances of it failing are high as well. Louise should avoid launching between May to September as the success rate plumets at this time.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

The percentage successful had a downward slope while percentage failed had an upward slope, indicating that if Louise wants a play to have a greater chance at succeeding, she should keep the goal between $30,000 to $44,999, any more than that and the chance of success falls while the chance of failure soars. 
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
Some of the difficulties that I encountered was creating the perfect formula in the “Outcomes Based on Goal” sheet in the excel file. There were many parts to the formula, so it took me a bit of time to get it right.
## Results
A limitation of the “Outcomes Based on Goals” chart is that the percentage canceled was zero, so we were not able to compare all three. The same can be applied to the “Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date” chart as the amount that was canceled was so low compared to the other two that we could not make conclusions based on all three factors.

Another graph that can be created is a stacked bar chart, which we could use to compare different categories. If Louise wanted to see each category’s success to failure ratio, she can use this stacked bar chart to visualize it.
